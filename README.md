# Qinnovate

**From brain-dumps to frameworks and tangible results.*

Qinnovate develops open frameworks, protocols, and governance alignment with tools for securing brain-computer interfaces. Vendor-agnostic. Community-driven. Apache 2.0.

The standards bodies that shaped the internet didn't build browsers. They built the rules that made browsers possible. Qinnovate does the same for neural interfaces.

## The TARA Insight

TARA started as an attack matrix. I catalogued 109 BCI attack techniques from a pure security mindset, and something unexpected happened: the same mechanisms kept showing up on the therapeutic side.

Signal injection is an attack vector. It is also the basis of neurostimulation therapy for depression, Parkinson's, and chronic pain. Replay attacks are a threat. Repetitive stimulation protocols are a treatment. The RF mapping techniques an adversary uses to map a building through WiFi walls are the same physics a clinician would use to calibrate a visual prosthesis through electrodes.

About 75% of the 103 techniques map to a therapeutic counterpart today. The boundary between attack and therapy is not mechanism. It is consent, dosage, and oversight.

This means the same framework that scores whether an attack is dangerous can also bound whether a therapy is safe. TARA is both a threat registry and a safety specification. The dual-use mapping is the point.

**If injection attacks are real, then the inverse is also real: controlled injection can treat. The security model IS the safety model.**

## Neurorights Map

Everything Qinnovate builds traces back to five neurorights defined by Ienca & Andorno (2017) and Yuste et al. (2017). This table maps each right to the specific framework, tool, or document that enforces it.

| Neuroright | What It Protects | Enforced By |
|------------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Cognitive Liberty** | Freedom from unauthorized interference with mental self-determination | [QIF](qif-framework/) (coherence metric detects injected signals), [Neurowall](tools/neurowall/) (blocks unauthorized stimulation at the hardware layer), [NISS](https://qinnovate.com/scoring/) CG metric (scores cognitive compromise severity) |
| **Mental Privacy** | Neural data and mental states stay confidential | [NSP](qif-framework/nsp/) (PQ encryption of all BCI data in transit), [TARA](https://qinnovate.com/TARA/) (catalogues 109 data exfiltration vectors), [Data Policy](governance/DATA_POLICY_FAQ.md) (retention and deletion rules), [Informed Consent](governance/INFORMED_CONSENT_FRAMEWORK.md) |
| **Mental Integrity** | Protection from unauthorized alteration of neural function | [QIF](qif-framework/) (signal coherence scoring flags anomalies), [NISS](https://qinnovate.com/scoring/) BI metric (quantifies tissue/pathway damage), [Neurowall](tools/neurowall/) (real-time anomaly detection pipeline), [Runemate](qif-framework/runemate/) (TARA validates every stimulation pattern before delivery) |
| **Psychological Continuity** | Personal identity and sense of self remain intact | [NISS](https://qinnovate.com/scoring/) NP metric (tracks neuroplastic changes over time), [TARA](https://qinnovate.com/TARA/) dual-use mapping (bounds both attack severity and therapeutic safety), [Pediatric Considerations](governance/INFORMED_CONSENT_FRAMEWORK.md#pediatric--incapacity-considerations) (developing brains get extra protections), Project Firefly (privacy-first journaling for kids, coming soon) |
| **Equal Access** | BCI security is not limited to those who can pay | Apache 2.0 license (all specs, code, and data are open), [Open API](https://qinnovate.com/api/tara.json) (free STIX feed, no auth), [qtara SDK](https://pypi.org/project/qtara/) (free Python package), [macshield](tools/macshield/) (free workstation hardening) |

## Why Neurosecurity?

Three fields converge on BCIs. None of them covers the full problem alone.

**Neuroethics** writes the policies. What should and shouldn't be done with BCIs, what constitutes consent, what rights people have over their neural data. The 3 TARA techniques tagged "neuroethics_formalized" (identity erosion, agency manipulation, self-model corruption) came from neuroethics because those researchers were the first to articulate these as harms.

**Neuroscience** provides the mechanism understanding. How neural signals work, what's physically possible, what the attack surface looks like. The 46 "qif_recontextualized" techniques came from neuroscience, physics, and sensor research. You cannot build a defense if you don't understand the biology.

**Cybersecurity** operationalizes it. The gap is that neither neuroethics nor neuroscience has the operational security toolkit to detect, prevent, and respond to these threats. That's the QIF contribution: taking phenomena described by neuroscientists and concerns raised by neuroethicists and putting them into a formal, testable, scoreable security framework with NISS scores, attack chains, and detection mechanisms.

**The lesson from IT:** GRC (Governance, Risk, and Compliance) was retrofitted onto existing security infrastructure decades after the internet shipped. The result: compliance frameworks that lag years behind threats, checkbox security that satisfies auditors but not attackers. We need to learn from history and not repeat that, especially for the brain.

| Field | Contributes | Cannot Do Alone |
|-------|------------|----------------|
| Neuroethics | Policies, rights frameworks, consent models | Detect a P300 interrogation attack in real time |
| Neuroscience | Mechanism knowledge, attack surface understanding | Score severity, map attack chains, build detection systems |
| Cybersecurity | TTPs, scoring, detection, incident response | Understand neural biology or define neurorights |
| **Neurosecurity** | **All of the above, integrated** | **The bridge discipline** |

## Architecture

### QIF (Quantified Interconnection Framework)

The security model. An 11-band hourglass architecture: 7 neural bands (N7 Neocortex down to N1 Spinal Cord), a physical interface boundary (I0, the electrode-tissue interface), and 3 silicon bands (S1 Analog up to S3 Radio/Wireless).

- **Whitepaper:** [qinnovate.com/whitepaper](https://qinnovate.com/whitepaper/) (v6.2.1)
- **Academic Preprint:** [DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.18640105](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18640105) (28 pages, CC-BY 4.0, always latest version)
- **Specification:** [qif-framework/](qif-framework/)
- **Interactive explorer:** [qinnovate.com/lab/hourglass.html](https://qinnovate.com/lab/hourglass.html)

### NSP (Neural Security Protocol)

The wire protocol (v0.5). Post-quantum encryption (ML-KEM-768, ML-DSA, AES-256-GCM-SIV) at the frame level. Designed for implant-class hardware: sub-4ms latency, under 4% power overhead on ARM Cortex-M4.

- **Spec:** [qinnovate.com/nsp](https://qinnovate.com/nsp/)
- **Implementation:** [qif-framework/nsp/nsp-core/](qif-framework/nsp/nsp-core/) (Rust, PQ-secure)

### TARA (Therapeutic Atlas of Risks and Applications)

The threat-therapy registry. 109 techniques spanning 8 domains and 15 tactics. Each technique scored with CVSS v4.0 base vectors + NISS extension metrics. MITRE-compatible IDs.

- **Registry:** [qinnovate.com/TARA](https://qinnovate.com/TARA/)
- **API:** [qinnovate.com/api/stix.json](https://qinnovate.com/api/stix.json) (STIX 2.1 Feed)
- **Data:** [shared/qtara-registrar.json](shared/qtara-registrar.json)
- **SDK:** `pip install qtara`

### Open API

The full TARA dataset is available as a public JSON API. No auth required.

| Endpoint | What It Returns |
|----------|----------------|
| [`/api/tara.json`](https://qinnovate.com/api/tara.json) | All techniques with CVSS v4.0 vectors, NISS scores, DSM-5-TR diagnostic mappings, physics feasibility constraints, therapeutic analogs, FDA status, safe dosing parameters, governance requirements, and engineering specs. |
| [`/api/stix.json`](https://qinnovate.com/api/stix.json) | Same data as a STIX 2.1 Bundle. Drop it into any STIX-compatible threat intel platform. |

Each technique includes: attack mechanism, QIF band mapping, dual-use classification (attack vs. therapy), clinical conditions treated by the same mechanism, regulatory crosswalk (FDA, IEC, ISO), DSM-5-TR codes (primary and secondary), and physics coupling parameters.

### NISS (Neural Impact Scoring System)

The scoring extension. First CVSS v4.0 extension designed for neural interfaces. Five metrics that CVSS structurally cannot express:

| Metric | Code | What It Measures |
|--------|------|-----------------|
| Biological Impact | BI | Tissue damage, neural pathway disruption |
| Cognitive Integrity | CG | Memory, attention, executive function compromise |
| Consent Violation | CV | Whether the subject knew and agreed |
| Reversibility | RV | Can the damage be undone? |
| Neuroplasticity | NP | Long-term adaptive/maladaptive neural changes |

- **Scoring:** [qinnovate.com/scoring](https://qinnovate.com/scoring/)
- **Spec:** [qif-framework/NISS-v1.0-SPEC.md](qif-framework/NISS-v1.0-SPEC.md) (pending publication)

### Runemate

The rendering pipeline. v1.0 introduces a native DSL compiler achieving 67.8% compression (1059 B source to 341 B bytecode). Phase 2/3 compiles semantic content into electrode stimulation patterns for direct cortical rendering. The long-term goal is vision restoration: translating visual information into signals a blind patient's visual cortex can interpret.

The Forge (gateway compiler, Rust std) compiles content. The Scribe (implant interpreter, Rust no_std, ~200KB) renders it. TARA validates every output pattern before delivery, bounding both attack severity and therapeutic safety.

- **Spec:** [qinnovate.com/runemate](https://qinnovate.com/runemate/) (v1.0, 19 sections, ~2900 lines)
- **Compiler:** [qif-framework/runemate/forge/](qif-framework/runemate/forge/) (native DSL-to-Staves, encrypted)
- **Full specification:** [qif-framework/RUNEMATE.md](qif-framework/RUNEMATE.md)
